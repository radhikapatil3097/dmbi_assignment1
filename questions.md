nswer Following Questions in detail.
   
   What is Machine Learning ?
   
   Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate in             predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can  receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output value within an acceptable range. 
    

What is Data Science ?

Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.
   
  
  What is Data Mining ?
  
  Data Mining is the practice of examining large pre-existing databases in order to generate new information.
    
  
  What is Data Analytics ?
  
  Data analytics refers to qualitative and quantitative techniques and processes used to enhance productivity and business gain. Data is extracted and categorized to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns, and techniques vary according to organizational requirements.

    
    
   What are the tools used for the Data Mining ?
    
   Orange
Weka
Python with libraries
R Programming
Hadoop
KNIME

   
   Explain the Limitations of the tools which you have listed in the above questions answer.
   
   KNIME: Plenty of data integration modules are already included in the core version.
Python : It requries libraries for data integration, manipulation and  visualization.
R : Mostly used for statistical modelling.
Orange : All the functionality are present in python which is light weight language.
    
    
   What are the tasks in the Machine Learning ?
   
   Prediction
Classification 
Regression
EDA analysis
Pattern Discovery


   
   Give at least 5 examples of the tasks which you have given in above question.
   
   Netflix
    Flipkart  
    Myntra 
    Amazon Prime 
    Trivago 
     
   
   Do a research of what is the impact of Machine Learning on the society
   
   Machine learning algorithms are evolving in every industry – translating text, identifying faces in photographs, recognising handwriting, piloting drones, driving cars, and so on. And now, machine learning is moving into social, education, and medicine – diverse areas like predicting which participants will drop out of drug-trials and improving selection processes in recruitment.
  
  
  Research for privacy and machine learning.
  
  As machine learning become increasingly powerful, algorithms could conceivably make high confidence predictions without having direct access to your private information. This was already seen to an extent when retailer Target’s predictive algorithm suggested a girl was pregnant and sent her promotional material accordingly - accidentally revealing the secret to her father, but in future it may not even be necessary to have access to any of her personal details to figure it out. In this world, there is no such thing as private information. Given the emphasis that so many put on privacy, the reaction to this is likely to be highly negative.
